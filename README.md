* AFTER_PROCESS_TRAIN_PATH = "related path to after_train.csv"
* AFTER_PROCESS_TEST_PATH = "related path to after_test.csv"
* SAMPLE_SUBMISSION_PATH = "related path to sample_submission.csv"
* Model_PATH = "related path to model folder/"
*the submission file you want to place
    SUBMISSION_PATH = "related path to final_0811619.csv"
